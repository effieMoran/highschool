This is an API REST that responds to 4 methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE).
Given a student (name/surname/file/career/subjectsApproved) the Api should contains methods to:
-List all Students;
-Add a Student;
-Modify fields given the student file;
-Erase a student;

You can try it using postman or similar service ;)
